## The Democracy Earth Foundation Handbook


<img src='loomio-phone.png' class='img-right img-250px'>

The software we build is [open source](http://github.com/DemcracyEarth/), and our organization is open source too... be sure to check out the DEF Open Source [Manifesto] (https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper) on git, all contributors are welcome. 

The DEF organizational handbook is where we document how we run DEF efficiently and effectively as a **distributed, open, non-hierarchichal organization** using the best open source tools available. 

At Democracy Earth we build software for collaborative decision making, used by thousands of organisations and communities around the world. Our greatest impact will not necessarily be to make governments more democratic, but to make any kind and size of institution, whether public or private, more engaging. If youâ€™re looking for a way to make group decisions within any organization of people - whether it contains two to two billion - you'll want to be a [Sovereign](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign) decision-maker...join the movement.
