## The Democracy Earth Foundation Handbook


<img src= add image here>

The software we build is [open source](http://github.com/DemcracyEarth/), and our organization is open source too... be sure to check out the DEF Open Source [White Paper and Manifestor, "The Smart Social Contract"] (https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper) on GitHub, all contributors are welcome. 

This DEF organizational handbook is where we document how we run DEF efficiently and effectively as a **distributed, open, non-hierarchichal organization** using the best open source tools available.  

At Democracy Earth we build software for collaborative decision making, used by thousands of organisations and communities around the world. Our greatest impact will not necessarily be to make governments more democratic, but to make any kind and size of institution, whether public or private, more engaging. If youâ€™re looking for a way to make group decisions within any organization of people - whether it contains two or two billion - you'll want to join the movement to be a [Sovereign](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign) decision-maker. 

To learn more about he history of Democracy Earth and the values that drive us, check out our founder vidoes, below..and let's keep talking.

## About this handbook

We are fans of open source, and we forked this handbook from another open source company, loomio, who talked about their organizational philosophy on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12348909). We liked what they had to say and saw a lot of parallels in our values and approach.  For us, it's all about transparency and engaging;  you might even say it's our code =).

You can find the original code for this handbook [on Github](https://github.com/loomio/loomio-coop-handbook).
