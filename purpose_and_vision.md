# Purpose & Vision

**Democracy Earth exists to enable a borderless world of global citizens with full personal sovereignty to participate in the decisions and debates that affect their personal, working and civic lives.**

Humans are social creatures; if Descarte was right ("I think, therefore I am") and thinking is the fundamental building block of being, then surely organizing is the fundamental building block of being with others.  "We organize, therefore we decide." At Democracy Earth we create digital decision-making tools for organizations to make decisions that give a voice to all participants.

## Values

### We are global citizens

The DEF is a worker owned and operated collective of developers, hacktivists and social entrepreneurs pioneering a new style of political engagment with planetary impact.DEF is creating tools that give everyone the experience of being a digital nomad in a borderless world, embracing the entire earth as their home. 

### Collaboration

The DEF white paper - introducing the VOTE token to the world - resides on GitHub where more than 19 contributors from 15 countries collaborated to bring the vision of a Social Smart Contract into sharp focus. By desire and design, the Sovereign governance platform will truly be decision-making software of the people, by the people, for the people.

### User experience

The DEF secret sauce is core to everything we do: it should be easy to participate in the decsions that affect your life. 

### Dynamic representation

The tactic of liquid democracy can increase not only participation in decision-making, but also the shared understanding of the issues. The ability to dynamically delegate one's vote - one's power - is a powerful tool for political accountability. 
 
### Trust

Trust is the building block of every single institution in the world. DEF is leading coding new kinds of organizations with software; we are redefining the nature of law. 

The core building block that makes government possible is also the main interaction we have with the internet every day - voting.  


### Transparency

Democracy Earth will maintain an active commitment to transparency and community engagement. From interacting on open source platforms like Github and Slack, to publishing content on channels like Medium and SoundCloud, to social sharing on Twitter and Facebook, DEF is dedicated to creating and maintaining multiple lines of communication to users and contributors.
