# Purpose & Vision

**Democracy Earth exists to enable a borderless world of global citizens with full personal sovereignty to participate in the decisions and debates that affect their personal, working and civic lives.**

Humans are social creatures; if Descarte was right ("I think, therefore I am") and thinking is the fundamental building block of being, then surely organizing is the fundamental building block of being with others.  "We organize, therefore we decide." At Democracy Earth we create digital decision-making tools for organizations to make decisions that give a voice to all participants.

## Values

### Collaboration

The DEF white paper - introducing the VOTE token to the world - resides on GitHub where more than 19 contributors from 15 countries collaborated to bring the vision of a Social Smart Contract into sharp focus. By desire and design, the Sovereign governance platform will truly be decision-making software of the people, by the people, for the people.
