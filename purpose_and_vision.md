# Purpose & Vision

**Democracy Earth exists to enable a borderless world of global citizens with full personal sovereignty to participate in the decisions and debates that affect their personal, working and civic lives.**

Humans are social creatures; if Descarte was right ("I think, therefore I am") and thinking is the fundamental building block of being, then surely organizing is the fundamental building block of being with others.  "We organize, therefore we decide." At Democracy Earth we create digital decision-making tools for organizations to make decisions that give a voice to all participants.

## Values

### Co-operative social enterprise

Loomio is a social enterprise collectively owned by the people building it. Unlike a traditional profit-maximising company, revenue is not an end in itself, but a means towards achieving a core social purpose. A worker-owned cooperative structure is a powerful way to live our values of collaboration and collective ownership.

### Independent and neutral

Loomio is committed to remaining independent so it can provide a neutral place for any group to come together.

### Open-source collaboration

Loomio aims to develop open-source tools that make collaboration accessible to everyone.

### Adaptive, reflexive, user-driven

Loomio aims to develop tools which are iterative, self-reflexive and adaptive, driven by the collective wisdom of the user community.

### Transparency

The Loomio Co-operative will be surrounded by a valued community of users and contributors. This community must be confident that the Loomio Co-operative is doing what it says it is. We are committed to high standards for sharing information.
