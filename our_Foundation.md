# Our Foundation

Democracy Earth Foundation is a registered California nonprofit 501c3. 

Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations with open source and mobile technologies to organize, decide  and petition, free of dependencies on intermediary institutions. 

Trust is our highest value; Democracy Earth Foundation creates trust through incorruptible software that is as **decentralized**, **open**, and **collaborative** as we ourselves are.  We envision a virtually borderless world where everyone is a self-sovereign global citizen.

From open sourcing everything from our [employee handbook](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/handbook/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) to our [Sovereign software code](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign), to our decentralized approach to [building a global movement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0101233LE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), with foundation members collaborating across the various human boundaries of Nation States, languages, media and applications, Democracy Earth Foundation is [a living breathing example of its values](http://codingdemocracy.tv/).  

We have a passionate and very _public_ commitment to our values, as evidenced by this February 2016 article in The Guardian about co-founder Pia Mancin ["How one woman's app is changing politics in the digital age: Argentina’s Pia Mancini is using technology to destroy barriers between politicians and people around the world"](https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/feb/23/how-one-womans-app-is-changing-politics-in-the-digital-age) and this video presentation by co-founder Santiago Siri, ["Internet and blockchain-based technology, a revolution for Democracy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UajbQTHnTfM) delivered to L'Échappée Volée.
