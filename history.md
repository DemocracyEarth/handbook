# History

We have created a movement around decentralized democracy. It began in Argentina when DemocracyOS founders Santiago Siri and Pia Mancini started the NET political party...and open source politics was born.  After graduating from [Silicon Valleyâ€™s YCombinator](https://www.fastcompany.com/3043388/why-y-combinator-funded-a-radical-political-party-in-argentina) (as its first nonprofit graduate) and Fast Forward accelerators, we open sourced  [our code](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign) on November 8, 2016 - the day of the last American presidential election seemed like an auspicious one for open sourcing democracy.  

Shortly thereafter we piloted our Sovereign liquid democracy platform, in October 2016 as part of the [Colombian peace referendum of 2016](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062386/democracy-is-getting-a-reboot-on-the-blockchain), demonstrating how fully participatory democracy has the effect of reducing voter polarization, powerlessness and apathy among other very important and policy-relevant findings.  

Democracy Earth Foundation is the [2016 Singularity University Global Governance Challenge](https://su.org/summits/su-global-summit/) winner and a [Fast Company 2017 World Changing Ideas](https://www.fastcompany.com/3068873/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2017-world-changing-ideas-awards) finalist.
