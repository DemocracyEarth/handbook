# History

We have created a movement around decentralized democracy. It began in Argentina when DemocracyOS founders Santiago Siri and Pia Mancini started the NET political party...and open source politics was born.  After graduating from [Silicon Valleyâ€™s YCombinator](https://www.fastcompany.com/3043388/why-y-combinator-funded-a-radical-political-party-in-argentina) (as its first nonprofit graduate) and Fast Forward accelerators, we open sourced  [our code](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign) on the day of the American presidential electionwe. Shortly thereafter we piloted our Sovereign liquid democracy platform, in October 2016 as part of the [Colombian peace referendum of 2016](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062386/democracy-is-getting-a-reboot-on-the-blockchain), demonstrating how fully participatory democracy has the effect of reducing voter polarization, powerlessness and apathy among other findings.  

Democracy Earth Foundation is the [2016 Singularity University Global Governance Challenge](https://su.org/summits/su-global-summit/) winner and a [Fast Company 2017 World Changing Ideas](https://www.fastcompany.com/3068873/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2017-world-changing-ideas-awards) finalist.
